# Community Dataset Notebooks

Welcome to the **MSD-LIVE Community Dataset Notebooks** repository!  
This repository is a shared space where MSD-LIVE users can contribute Jupyter notebooks that explore, analyze, or visualize datasets hosted in the MSD-LIVE data repository.

If a dataset’s author has not linked their own GitHub repository for community submissions, notebooks for that dataset can be submitted here.

## 📚 Purpose

This repo serves as a **central collection of user-contributed notebooks** associated with datasets in MSD-LIVE.  
Each notebook should be organized by its dataset ID so it’s easy to find related work.

Example layout:

```
community-dataset-notebooks/
├── 2mhfk-90397/
│   ├── alaska_production_trends_jdoe.ipynb
│   └── README.md
└── 4zptn-10255/
    └── seabird_population_analysis_kcasey.ipynb
```

## 🧩 How to Contribute

Anyone with an MSD-LIVE account can contribute a notebook that uses a public dataset.

1. **Prepare your notebook**
   - Ensure your notebook runs start-to-finish without errors.
   - Include a clear title and markdown cells explaining your analysis.

2. **Submit through MSD-LIVE**
   - From your Jupyter Notebook environment, select the completed notebook(s), then click the **Pull Request (PR)** button provided by the MSD-LIVE extension.
   - The PR will include:
     - Your notebook file(s) (`.ipynb`)  
     - A short description of what your notebook does  

3. **Review process**
   - Admins will review your submission for clarity, dataset association, and safe content.
   - Once approved, your notebook will be merged into this repository, which is automatically cloned when users launch a Jupyter Notebook environment.
   - Your notebook will then be available to community members.

## 🧮 Notebook Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines to keep the collection consistent:
